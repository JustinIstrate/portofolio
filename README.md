## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio. More than just a static website, it is engineered as a dynamic showcase of my software engineering journey. It automatically fetches my best projects directly from GitHub and deploys automatically upon any code changes.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Live GitHub Integration:** The "Projects" section is fully automated. It uses the **GitHub REST API** to fetch and display my "Starred" repositories in real-time, including their descriptions, languages, and topics.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configured with **GitHub Actions**. Any `git push` to the main branch automatically triggers a build and deploys the optimized static files to GitHub Pages.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Built with Tailwind CSS, featuring a dark-themed, glassmorphism design with smooth CSS transitions and hover effects.
* **Fully Responsive:** Mobile-first approach ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (Desktops, Tablets, Smartphones).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React (Functional Components, Hooks)
* **Build Tool:** Vite (for lightning-fast HMR and optimized builds)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages & GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
* **API:** GitHub REST API v3
